Requirements
============

The core dependencies for this project are:

* Python 2.7
* NumPy 1.6
* SciPy 0.10

To compile the (optional) optimized functions (estimated speed-up is 3-4x), the
following additional packages are required:

* Cython 0.16
* BLAS (including headers)
* GSL (including headers)

Finally, some of the examples require matplotlib. Note that older versions of
the indicated packages may work, but they have not been tested.
